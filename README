A Turn-Key app

# What's a Turn-key app?

The app folder can be copied to anywhere and the app just works.
That means, the app doesn't depend on where it is installed.
Just copy and run!

# How to implement a Turn-key app?

First, the app's executable file must be able to find the dependency .so files.
This can be achieved by RPATH embedded in the elf format exe file.

Second, the app must be able to find its config file(s) based on where the app exe file's location. 
This can be done by getting the exe file's absouate path by itself. On Linux, /proc/self/exe is always a link to the absolute path of the exe file. So the exe can read it and get the file's path.

# A Turn-key app's basic layout

myapp/bin/
myapp/bin/app
myapp/conf/
myapp/conf/app.xml
myapp/lib/
myapp/lib/libfoo.so

Then, you can copy the "myapp" dir anywhere you want, and the app runs properly by itself.
